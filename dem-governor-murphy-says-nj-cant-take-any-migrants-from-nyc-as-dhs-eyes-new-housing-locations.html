Phil Murphy has said New Jersey does not have space for any migrants from New York City.</span> <span>(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</span></p><p>New York City politicians have said the city is overwhelmed by the more than 100,000 migrants the city has encountered since last year and have called for more federal action, including funding, an emergency declaration and expedited work authorizations.&nbsp;</p><p>Included in those recommendations from DHS were 11 federal sites across New York state and nearby where migrants could potentially be housed. Bloomberg News reported that those locations include the Atlantic City airport. It also reportedly includes Massena International Airport, which is a U.S. port of entry for the U.S.-Canada border.</p><p>Murphy, however, poured cold water on any such move Thursday.</p><p>“We are already seeing folks in New Jersey that have probably swelled into Jersey from New York City or from other locations, but you need scale, enormous amount of federal support — resources that go beyond anything that we can afford — putting everything else aside,” he said.</p><p>The statement by Murphy shows the political difficulties the Biden administration faces with the resettlement of migrants, who have streamed into the U.S. in the millions since the crisis began in 2021.</p><p>Many have moved north, either on their own or with the assistance of transportation by Texas and other states.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Democrats typically allied with the administration have been deeply critical of what they see as a lack of action to help them with what the states say is a federal problem.</p><p><strong>DHS CALLS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO NYC’S MIGRANT CRISIS OPERATIONS AS ADAMS PUSHES BACK</strong></p><p>Leaders in New York and other Democratic-run states have called for greater work authorization for migrants, federal emergency declarations and even more federal funding.</p><p>The DHS expert team had made a number of recommendations to New York City, while also renewing its own push for Congress to pass immigration reform to what it says is a “broken” system.&nbsp;</p><p>DHS also said this week it is launching a national campaign to help work-eligible migrants get employment authorization.</p><p><strong><u>NYC MIGRANT CRISIS COSTS COULD HIT $12 BILLION; MAYOR ADAMS URGES FEDERAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION</u></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/08/1200/675/Untitled-design-902.png><p><span>Hundreds of migrants sleeping outside the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan July 31, 2023.</span> <span>(Luiz C.

It’s not sustainable,” Adams told reporters. “If you average 10,000 people a month and if the national plan is to have New York City continue to find spaces, that is not an answer. And if the national plan is that slowly see if New York move more on the waiting list to get work authorization, that’s not an answer.”</p><p>Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.</p><p>He can be reached at <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=0e6f6a6f63207d666f793c4e686176206d6163>[email&nbsp;protected]</a> or on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJq6brPOr5yrpp%2Bneq7B0amfsmWjlsa0ec2jZJyZnql6ta3KnmSapqliuqqz0Zqlratdm7%2BwuYynsJxlkah6pbTSZpyynaNiu6bDjKGmrquZo7RuuM6cmK2hn6PAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wonka-film-review-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wonka movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)">&larr;
