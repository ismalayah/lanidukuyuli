While the world will remember him for his exemplary musical career, the man himself saw his four children as his true legacy.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Bennett has been married thrice; first to Patricia Beech, whom he separated from in 1965, followed by his marriage to actress Sandra Grant in 1971, before it ended in 1979. He then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">married his longtime love Susan Benedetto (née Crow)</a> in 2007 but remained involved in the lives of his four children from his first two marriages — D’Andrea “Danny” Bennett and Daegal “Dae” Bennett with Patricia Beech, along with Joanna and Antonia with Sandra Grant.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>In an interview with Forbes, the singer admitted that it was his four children and seven grandchildren who “make me proud.” His sons from his first marriage, Danny and Dae, worked with their father for years, managing his career.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>“They do a beautiful job. They just want me to sing and paint, and they take care of all of the details,” Tony gushed to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Post</a> back in 1985. “They work hard to make sure nothing rubs my dignity or pierces the vanity.”</p><h2 id=h-d-andrea-danny-bennett data-injectable=false>D’Andrea “Danny” Bennett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Danny-Bennett-son-of-Tony-Bennett.jpg><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Tony Bennett’s oldest son, Danny (69), was born in 1954 and managed his father’s career for more than 40 years, up until the singer decided to retire in 2021. Like his father, Danny tried his hand in the showbiz sector with his band Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends in 1973, which included his brother, Dae. But when success became a tough milestone to accomplish, he turned to business management.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Thus, when in 1979, Tony asked his son to hold the helm of his career and guide him after facing massive financial blows — which escalated to the point where the IRS was ready to seize his house — Danny accepted the offer and more than managed his father’s career. He saved it.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Danny rejuvenated Tony’s career with a new deal with his former label and marketing his father’s albums. The “Rags to Riches” singer always acknowledged his son’s contribution, thanking his lucky stars for Danny who was not only good at what he did but also genuinely cared about his father.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>“I realize how fortunate I am to have someone, in Danny, that is truly looking out for my best interests and not just in it for the money,” Tony told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Himself the father of three, Danny soon started his own entertainment management company <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RPM Productions</a>, which also collaborated with the likes of Ozzy Osbourne and Pearl Jam.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-daegal-dae-bennett data-injectable=false>Daegal “Dae” Bennett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dae-Bennett.jpg><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Born in 1955, Dae (68) lived with his mother and brother after his parents separated, but like Danny, he was deeply involved in music and then later, his father’s career.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=572 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=true>While his association with his brother’s band failed to attract success, he built his own music studio, Hillside Sound in his late 20s, which he eventually turned into the mega Bennett Studios that ran till 2011 before he closed it down. As shared on <a href=#>his website</a>, Dae — an audio engineer and drummer — worked with many wonders of the industry and won a total of 10 Grammys, which includes best traditional pop vocal album and best-engineered recording for Tony and Lady Gaga’s album Love for Sale. He also won a Grammy for producing Tony Bennett Celebrates 90.</p><h2 id=h-joanna-bennett data-injectable=false>Joanna Bennett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Joanna-Bennett-with-Tony-Bennett.jpg><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>The only Bennett child to steer away from the limelight, Joanna (53) was born in 1969 and was named after Tony’s 1964 song “When Joanna Loved Me.” While she never indulged in music, she, along with her sister, would often join their father during tours as shared by Antonia during a concert with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six,</a> and has attended red-carpet events with her family, like the Tony Bennett Celebrates 90: The Best Is Yet to Come event in 2016 hosted by NBA.</p><h2 id=h-antonia-bennett data-injectable=false>Antonia Bennett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Antonia-Bennett.jpg><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>Like her step-brothers and her father, 43-year-old Antonia Bennett (born in 1974) has built a career in music, with her debut album Embrace Me released in 2014 and her EP Natural in 2010. She often performed as Tony’s opening act during his performances.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>“Having a father that is so good at what he does is incredible,” she told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Times of Israel</a>. “I am constantly learning from him.
