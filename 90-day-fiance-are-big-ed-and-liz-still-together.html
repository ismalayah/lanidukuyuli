The couple, two of the 90 Day universe’s most famous alumni, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exchanged vows in a re-commitment ceremony at the couples’ retreat</a> where they took part in numerous therapies in an effort to save their relationship.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>During the event, Big Ed and Liz kicked the mock-wedding ceremony up a notch by proposing to one another — first Liz, then Ed, which Liz accepted. According to numerous reports, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the couple tied the knot for real</a> in August 2023, shortly after filming for The Last Resort wrapped.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>In more recent weeks, however, speculation has been rife online that the two reality stars are no longer together, with many theorists also suggesting that they may have moved on with someone new.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-big-ed-and-liz-s-journey-to-the-last-resort data-injectable=false>Big Ed and Liz’s journey to The Last Resort</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Big Ed first appeared on season four of 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days with his previous girlfriend, Rosemarie Vega, from the Philippines. After a series of major red flags on Big Ed’s part, from lying about his height and wanting to have children, to washing his hair with mayonnaise and telling his then-girlfriend that she stank and possibly has STDs, Ed and Rose parted ways.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Ed appeared on another spin-off, 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life, which followed his early relationship with Liz, who was working as a waitress at a restaurant Ed frequented. While initially a brief fling, the two reconnected and began dating as a serious couple, featuring on two seasons of The Single Life before getting engaged for the first time in 2021.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>By the time of their second reunion episode on The Single Life, many fellow cast members called out Ed for being narcissistic, with co-star Debbie Johnson telling Ed that he was only in love with himself. Around this time, an audio leaked online of Ed verbally abusing Liz, which likely influenced Ed’s frosty reception. However, the couple claimed that things were now better than it was during the filming of season two, as Ed was no longer friends with some of the more toxic influences in his life.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Ed and Liz appeared on another spin-off, 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, where many of Ed’s previous issues with Rose came to the fore once again. Ed accused Liz of having had frequent sexual partners and continuously gaslighted her, until they eventually broke off their engagement. By this reunion finale episode, however, the engagement was back on.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>However, Ed and Liz still had a lot of unresolved issues between them and their chequered past, prompting the couple to arrive at the Florida Keys couples’ retreat, as shown on The Last Resort.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Are Big Ed and Liz Woods still together?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ed-and-Liz-The-Last-Resort.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Rumors of a split began to swirl late last year, when Liz shared on her Instagram stories that filming had just wrapped on 90 Day Diaries, writing in December that “a lot” had happened since The Last Resort. Ed had also stopped appearing on Liz’s posts, only adding to speculation that they had split up once more.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Since then, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of Instagram stories</a> featuring a faceless mystery man have appeared on her social media, featuring Liz embracing him. Given Big Ed’s famous 4 feet, 10-inch height, a brief glance can quickly discern that the man is too tall to be Ed.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>On Sunday, February 11th,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Liz all but verbally confirmed this split</a>, celebrating the birthday of the mystery man — meaning it couldn’t be Big Ed, as his birthday is on April 28th.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>“Happy birthday bebe, I hope his mom knows that her son is taking good care of someone’s daughter,” Liz wrote on her story, with the latter comment perhaps alluding to her well-documented, troubled past with Ed.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=false>90 Day Diaries season 5 returned in January of this year, and Big Ed and Liz are yet to appear on this season so far. In order to avoid spoilers, it is likely that neither Ed nor Liz can outright state whether or not they are still together until their episode airs. This has often been the case for 90 Day cast members, often alluding to a split before outright confirming it once an episode documenting their break-up has aired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3x6fIydmLJllp6ur6%2FEZpirnV2Xtqh5xJ1kmqaUYrmqxoysq6KknGLBsLPErZ%2Beql8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-jeremy-allen-white-and-rosalia-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Jeremy Allen White and Rosala dating?">&larr;
